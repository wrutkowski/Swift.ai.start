# Swift.ai.start

Based on [SwiftCatalyst by danielraffel](https://github.com/danielraffel/SwiftCatalyst).

This project is a modern SwiftUI iOS template designed to make it easy to start building a project quickly using an AI coding tool like Cursor.

It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with native SwiftUI navigation to keep your code modular and scalable. The template includes built-in support for hot reloading in Cursor so you can see changes in the simulator as you work. It also comes with a set of custom Swift coding rules that guide style and best practices, including a meta-rule that helps you create new Cursor rules.

The project is pre-configured to work with Sweetpad for state previews, XcodeGen for project generation, SwiftLint for code quality enforcement, and InjectionNext for runtime code injection. This setup aims to make it easier to stay consistent, iterate quickly, and extend your codebase with AI assistance using Rules. Tested in Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, and VS Code.

---

### 4. **Generate Project File**

Run the included script to generate your project.yml from the template:

```bash
chmod +x generate-project.sh
./generate-project.sh
```

This will:
- Generate a `project.yml` file with your custom values
- Run XcodeGen to create the Xcode project
- Inform you of the process with detailed logs

---

### 5. **Install InjectionNext for Hot Reloading**

- **Download InjectionNext**:
   - Get the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionNext/releases/latest)

After building [you should see this.](https://github.com/danielraffel/SwiftCatalyst/blob/main/README.md#-what-it-looks-like)

You're now ready to start building! This is just a placeholder view—go ahead and replace it with / create your own custom MVVM module.

---

## Hot Reloading with InjectionNext

Hot reloading is already configured in this template using the [Inject](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject) framework (version >=1.5.0). **The Cursor rules in this project should configure new views with the requirements described below.**

### Setting Up Hot Reloading

- Start InjectionNext before running your project

### Using Hot Reloading

To apply changes while the app is running in the simulator:

1. Make changes to any SwiftUI view
2. Save the file
3. The changes will be immediately reflected in the simulator

Each SwiftUI view should:
- Import the Inject framework
- Include `@ObserveInjection var inject` property
- Add `.enableInjection()` to the view body

Example:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Inject

struct MyView: View {
    @ObserveInjection var inject

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .enableInjection()
    }
}
```

## MVVM Module Structure

Each module follows the MVVM architecture pattern:

- **View**: SwiftUI view responsible for UI rendering and user interactions
- **ViewModel**: Manages the view's state and business logic, uses @Published properties
- **Interactor**: Contains data layer logic and communicates with external sources
- **Entity**: Data models used by the ViewModel and Interactor

Navigation is handled using native SwiftUI `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink` with `navigationDestination`.

## Creating a New MVVM Module

To create a new module, follow this structure:

1. Create a new folder under `Sources/Modules/`
2. Add the MVVM components (View, ViewModel, Interactor, Entity)
3. Implement the module's functionality following the MVVM pattern
4. Use `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink` for navigation between views

## Customizing the Project

To rename the project or customize other aspects:

1. **Using Environment Configuration (Recommended)**
   - Create a custom `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Run `./generate-project.sh` to generate your project.yml with custom values
   - This approach allows you to easily configure:
     - Project name
     - Bundle IDs
     - Team ID
     - App Group ID
     - Other project-wide settings

2. **Manual Customization**
   - Manually change the `name` property in `project.yml` (after creating it from the template)
   - Update `bundleIdPrefix` and other settings as needed
   - Regenerate the project using XcodeGen

Regardless of approach, consider:
- Renaming the root module from `Home` to something more descriptive for your application
- Updating module names to match your application's domain

## Custom Keyboard Shortcuts in Cursor for Sweetpad

For an efficient development workflow in Cursor, configure these keyboard shortcuts to work better with Sweetpad:

1. **Open Cursor Settings**:
   - Press `Cmd+,` (Command + Comma)
   - Select "Keyboard Shortcuts"

2. **Add these shortcuts**:
- `Cmd+Shift+B` → Build & run
- `Cmd+Shift+K` → Clean build

## FAQ

### 📌 Where can I find my `TEAM_ID`, `APP_GROUP_ID`, and other Apple Developer values?

When setting up your `.env` file for the project, you'll need to supply values like `APP_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX`, `APP_GROUP_ID`, and `TEAM_ID`.

Here's where to find each of them in your [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/):

#### `APP_NAME`

This is your app's display name—**define it yourself in the ENV** traditionally you would do that in:
- **Xcode**: Target settings > General > Display Name
- **App Store Connect**: "My Apps" > Select app

#### `BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX`

Typically in the form `com.yourcompany`, this is the custom portion of your app's bundle identifier.

You define it when you create the app's App ID in:
- [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) > Identifiers

#### `APP_GROUP_ID`

Used for sharing data between app targets. Looks like: `group.com.yourcompany.yourawesomeapp`.

To create:
1. Go to [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/applicationGroup)
2. Select your app or create one
3. Enable **App Groups** and register a new one

Then add this group in Xcode under:
- **Signing & Capabilities** > App Groups

#### `TEAM_ID`

Your 10-character Apple Team ID. Find it at:
- [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account#MembershipDetailsCard)

#### `.env` Example

These values are then placed in your `.env` file like so:

```env
APP_NAME=YourAwesomeApp
BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX=com.yourcompany
APP_GROUP_ID=group.com.yourcompany.yourawesomeapp
TEAM_ID=ABCDEF1234
```

---

### 👀 What It Looks Like

After completing setup and running the app, you should see a screen like this:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dec6ed0-50ab-4288-ad5f-e6ffa68e292d" alt="Simulator Screenshot" width="20%" />

This shows:
- A **Home** title from the default module
- A welcome message and confirmation of **hot reloading** status
- A **Load Items** button wired to the ViewModel and Interactor
- A list of example topics (`Swift`, `UIKit`, etc.) fetched via MVVM flow

You can customize this screen by modifying the Home module or adding new MVVM modules.

### 📄 What do the [cursor rule](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) files in this project do?
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [cursor-rules-creation.mdc](/.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-creation.mdc) | A meta-rule that serves as a template/guide for creating new cursor rules specifically formatted for Swift and VIPER architecture. |
| [git-commits.mdc](/.cursor/rules/git-commits.mdc) | Automated rule for creating standardized Git commits in conventional format for Swift projects and all related assets. |
| [swift-viper-architecture.mdc](/.cursor/rules/swift-viper-architecture.mdc) | Contains the project's Swift coding standards and implementation patterns for our VIPER architecture with hot reloading. |

#### Using **`cursor-rules-creation.mdc`** (the meta-rule):
The meta-rule makes creating new rules simple:
1. **Notice a pattern** you want to codify in your codebase
2. **Open a Cursor chat**
3. **Point the AI to your meta-rule** by saying:
   ```
   Using the @cursor-rules-creation.mdc guide...
   ```
4. **Ask it to write a new rule** based on your conversation, for example:
   ```
   Write a rule for our networking layer implementation based on this chat
   ```
5. **Copy the generated rule content** from the chat - Cursor won't save it automatically
6. **Create a new `.mdc` file** in the `.cursor/rules/` directory and paste the content
7. **Commit the new rule** for team sharing

#### When should I create new rules?
Create new rules when:
- Establishing patterns for new features or components
- Setting conventions for specific areas of the codebase (like networking, data models, or UI components)
- Documenting implementation requirements that you find yourself explaining repeatedly
- Adding new architectural patterns or third-party integrations

---

#### Using **`git-commits.mdc`**:
The git commits rule automatically:
1. **Detects file changes** after successful builds or edits
2. **Analyzes the change type** based on file type and description
3. **Determines appropriate scope** based on Swift/VIPER architecture patterns
4. **Formats commit messages** according to conventional commits standard:
   ```
   feat(view): add user profile screen
   fix(networking): resolve API authentication issue
   refactor(presenter): extract presentation logic
   assets(media): add onboarding video
   ```
5. **Groups related files** intelligently based on module structure

---

#### Using **`swift-viper-architecture.mdc`**:
1. **Automatic activation**: These rules are automatically applied when editing matching Swift files.

2. **Manual activation**: In a Cursor chat, you can reference this rule with:
   ```
   @swift-viper-architecture.mdc
   ```

---

#### Using Configuration in Code

The Configuration.swift file is included in the template and provides access to all environment variables:

```swift
// Example usage
let appName = Configuration.appName
let apiUrl = Configuration.apiBaseURL
```

You don't need to manually import the Configuration file in each of your files - it's available throughout the project.

---

### ✅ Recommended Project Locations for InjectionNext
To avoid permission issues, store your Xcode project outside of:

```
~/Desktop
~/Documents
~/Downloads
Any folder synced with iCloud Drive
```

Instead, use a location like:

```
~/Developer/
~/Projects/
~/Coding/
~/Code/
```
You can create a folder like ~/Developer/MyApp and move your project there.
